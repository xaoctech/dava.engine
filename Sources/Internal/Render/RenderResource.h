	\ingroup render
	\brief 
            Base class for render system resources. All render system resources must be derived from this class.
 
    Thoughts about RenderResource
    RenderResource - can be the one that require invalidation and ones that not require. For example:

    Low-level resources
    - Texture - require invalidation. From DISK.
    - Shader - require invalidation. From DISK, or Memory.
    - VBO, IBO - require invalidation. From somewhere.
    
    High-level resources
    - Sprite - sometimes can require reload, looks like the same as invalidation.
    - All types of meshes - do not require any type of reload. Sometimes should provide data to underlying VBOs, IBOs.
    - Material - do not require invalidation.
