/**
	 Interface for requesting packs from server.

	 Typical work flow:
	 1. connect to state change signal and to request update signal
	 2. call Initialize to connect to server, wait for state become `Pack::Status::Ready`
	 3. request pack from server or mount local automatically on request

	 example:
	 ```
	 DLCManager& pm = *engine.GetContext()->dlcManager;
	 // if initialize failed we will know about it
	 pm.networkReady.Connect(this, &DLCManagerTest::OnNetworkReady);

	 FilePath folderWithDownloadedPacks = "~doc:/FolderForPacks/";
	 String urlToServerSuperpack = "http://server.net/superpack.3.7.0.mali.dvpk";
	 DLCManager::Hints hints;
	 hints.logFilePath = "~doc:/UberGame/dlc_manager.log";
	 hints.retryConnectMilliseconds = 1000; // retry connect every second
	 hints.maxFilesToDownload = 22456; // help download manager to reserve memory better

	 pm.Initialize(folderWithDownloadedPacks, urlToServerSuperpack, hints);

	 // now we can connect to request signal, and start requesting packs

	 ```
