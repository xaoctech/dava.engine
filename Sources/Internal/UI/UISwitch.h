 * buttonLeft.relativePosition.x and buttonRight.relativePosition.x mark movement bounds for 'toggle': it does mean that toggle never leaves 
 * space between pivot points of these controls. So if you want to have toggle that moves between the left edge of 'buttonLeft' and 
 * the right edge of 'buttonRight' set buttonLeft.pivotPoint.x = 0 and buttonRight.pivotPoint.x = buttonRight.size.dx.
 *
 * Default sizes for buttonLeft, buttonRight and toggle are set only once in UISwitch ctor and only if you provide 'rect' argument.
 * After this they never adjust their sizes and it's your responsibility to control this parameter.
 *
 * Don't use GetButtonXXX()->GetSelected() to determine what side is currently selected: GetIsLeftSelected() is what you need.
